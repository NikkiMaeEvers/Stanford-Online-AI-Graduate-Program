# Stanford School of Engineering – AI Graduate Program (Unofficial)

This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and projects while following courses from the [Stanford School of Engineering’s AI Graduate Program](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-program).  

I am not enrolled in the official, paid program — meaning I do not receive certificates or formal credit. Instead, I use these materials to **refresh and deepen my AI knowledge** after completing my **BSc and MSc in Artificial Intelligence**.

## Courses I Am Following:
- 1st Elective: **Deep Learning for Computer Vision (Elective)**  

Planned next courses:
- 1 Required course: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques
- 2 Additional electives (to reach 4 in total)

I will update this list as I progress.

## Program Structure (Official)
To officially complete the graduate program, students must take:
- **At least 1 required course**
- **2 to 3 electives**
- 
For a total of **4 courses**.

More information can be found on the [official program page](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-program).
